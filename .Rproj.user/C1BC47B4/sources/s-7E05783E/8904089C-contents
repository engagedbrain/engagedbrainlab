H∪B stands for Human ∪nionized Behavior and represents how we study the human mind. Rather than focusing on cognitive functions in isolation, we study the interactions and interdependencies among numerous cognitive processes.

In our research we draw from multiple disciplinary and theoretical stances and utilize converging methodologies in order to holistically probe the interactions of cognitive processes.
